This project is for learning purposes only. Coded in pure C and OpenGL+SDL.
SDL is only used for the audio and input, all rendering is done in OpenGL.

I intend to provide support for original game files and sounds, as well
as support for custom content. Game files are included inside of
catacomb_data.h in static byte arrays.

The original Catacomb for DOS can be found and downloaded here:
